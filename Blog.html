                    <h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT FOR CREATING VALUE</h2>
                    <time datetime="2017-06-05">05 de junho de 2017</time>

                    <p>Value proposition is the reason clients pick one company over the other, a product over another or even a service over other services. Value propositions are the compilation of benefits for the user, be it short-term or long-term benefits, and for a long time it has been just that, something that will benefit the product/service user.</p>

                    <p>Recently, the rising preoccupation with preserving the environment for future generations has opened doors for a new market that seeks to solve current problems of residue generation and destination, pollutants emissions, energy waste and materials. Moreover, as simplistic as this may sound, two words can sum up the answer to these problems: Sustainable development.</p>

                    <p>Sustainable development is, as defined in the “Brundtland Report” (1978), “<em>the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs</em>”. “But what all of this has to do with value propositions”, you may ask, the short answer is everything, the newfound need to save the world has done two things: Expand the creation of value beyond the user benefits, and enable the opportunity to use sustainability as a value.</p>

                    <p>To exemplify the expansion of value beyond the user benefits, a 2015 online study done by Nielsen shows that, at that time, 66% of the interviewed consumers would pay more for their products and services based on a number of factors and, among those, the sustainability factor was present in around 58% of the interviewee’s reasons to pay more. The sustainability factor takes into account things like product freshness, natural/organic ingredients, environmental and social responsibility. Money is and always will be the best way to measure something’s value, so if clients are now opening up to pay more, it can only mean one thing: They see value in it.</p>

                    <p>So how do we tap into this new fountain of value opportunities? Well, there are two ways to work with sustainability:</p>

                    <h3>1. Creating value with the environment:</h3>

                    <p>The first method, and the easiest, is to create value with the environment, making your products and services have less impact with actions such as using “greener” materials or reducing the energetic and raw material needed. Google’s initiatives have some good examples for creating value with the environment, where they use their advanced data recovery technology to simply provide guidelines and information that incites sustainability, the use of that data, however, is up to the world, which brings us to the second way of acting on sustainability, creating value for the environment;</p>

                    <h3>2. Creating value for the environment:</h3>

                    <p>The second method is much harder, as you`ll seek to place environment over value, simply put, create value for, not with, the environment. Creating for the environment means making sure that, for example, you could focus on eliminating programmed obsolescence on products instead of just using “greener materials”, or digitalizing your company to reduce the office space needed, emissions related to keeping this office and the logistic of your employees, etc. This type of solution has much more impact in the world itself and, while it does require more work and resources, if used as a value, it has a much stronger punch as well. Another point to this, for an instance, the Ecotax system, which is ever growing and reduces a number of taxes based on government policies, making companies undoubtedly more profitable and marketable.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, Sustainable Development has been used for over a decade now in companies that are as big as they were ahead of their time. As seen in Rebecca Henderson’s paper, “Making the Business Case for Environmental Sustainability” (2015), companies like Walmart and Coca-Cola earned big time investing on the environment. Take IBM for example, according to Henderson, they were able to reduce their energetic needs, cutting down on 6.4 billion kilowatt-hours in 23 years, which saved them 513 million dollars, not counting intangible benefits such as image and marketing. Nevertheless, sustainability is not only about making money or marketing, in Project Sunroof, one of the aforementioned Google’s initiatives, it’s noted that if a second of sunlight energy received by the world was somehow captured, it would be enough to power every residence and industry for a whole year. Can you imagine the possible outcomes of having only clean, renewable energy in the world’s matrix? This kind of change would bring no more emissions from fossil fuels, no more global warming and a much better life quality. So, on that note, I ask you, the reader, one question: <strong>Do you think Sustainable Development is/would be important for your company?</strong></p>
